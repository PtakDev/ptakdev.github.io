##### Hello there! 
My name is `Piotr` and recently I have landed my first job in IT and I am super excited about it.

This website is powered by [`Jekyll`](https://jekyllrb.com/){:target="_blank"} with [`Chirpy`](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy){:target="_blank"} theme and it's being used to keep my notes and docs for `homelabs`, `projects` and `school`, and have those available from any place in the world. 

##### Hardware
If anyone is telling you that you need "super computer" to be able to learn tchnology and do dome experiments, he or she is lying. 
I am running my labs and VMs on my `Dell Latitude 5480` laptop. 

###### OS: `Windows 10 Pro`
###### Processor: `Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-7200U CPU @ 2.50GHz   2.70 GHz`
###### RAM: `16.0 GB`
